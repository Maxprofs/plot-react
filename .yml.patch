Speeding up site generation
Every release we post long changelogs to the website. This slows down generation of the website significantly! We include some tools to temporarily exclude the blog posts that you're not working on out of the way.

bundle exec rake isolate[filename-of-blogpost]
When you're done working on the site, run the following command to move the posts back again:

bundle exec rake integrate
