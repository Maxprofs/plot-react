Get ready for development
repo doesn't create local branches for you, hence you end up with a detached head that points to the last known good commit.

Before you start developing make sure you have local branches:

repo forall -c 'git checkout $REPO_RREV'
Now set git to use the commit template that will help you write good commit messages:

ROOTDIR=$(pwd) repo forall -c 'git config commit.template $ROOTDIR/misc/repotools/.commit-template'
